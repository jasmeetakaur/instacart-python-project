# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis Project
Instacart online grocery store management system
## Introduction 
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app., already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors.
## Objective
The goal of the project is to 
* perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.
* by using targeted marketing strategy Instacart wants to target the right customer profiles with the appropriate products to boost their sales.
## Key questions
* What the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders?
* Whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times?
* Are there simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts?
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
* Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
* What’s the distribution among customers in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
* Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
